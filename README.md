## Getting Started

Getting started with BaseHTML is easy. Simply include the following CDN links in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/searchhero/basehtml/css/main.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/searchhero/basehtml/js/basehtml.js"></script>
```

Once you have added these links to your HTML file, you can start using BaseHTML on your default HTML forms.

## Usage

BaseHTML is designed to be simple and easy to use. Simply add the `basehtml` class to your HTML form element to get started:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

By default, BaseHTML will apply its default styles to your form elements. However, you can also customize the styles by adding a custom CSS file to your HTML file and overriding the default styles.
