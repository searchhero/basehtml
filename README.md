## Getting Started

Getting started with BaseHTML is easy. Simply include the following CDN links in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/searchhero/basehtml/css/basehtml.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/searchhero/basehtml/js/basehtml.js"></script>
```

Once you have added these links to your HTML file, you can start using BaseHTML on your default HTML forms.

## Usage

BaseHTML appears to be a web development framework or library that is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward. According to the statement you provided, one of its features is that it does not require the addition of any classes when using it to build web pages.

In HTML and CSS, classes are often used to apply specific styles or behaviors to certain elements on a page. However, by not requiring the use of classes, BaseHTML may simplify the process of creating web pages for developers who are new to web development or who prefer a minimalist approach.

It's important to note that while not using classes may make BaseHTML simpler to use, it may also limit the flexibility and customization options available to developers who want more control over the appearance and functionality of their web pages.

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

By default, BaseHTML will apply its default styles to your form elements.
